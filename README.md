# Dutchsilab (Daedalus) - Dotfiles
I started rough, I was searching alot in the beginning. But it made sense in the end!

**What did I add to my Terminal?**
* Added my own welcome message (reference: Arnold Schwarzenegger).
* Changed the look and color of my terminal.
* Added some useful aliasses.
* Installed the components of Homebrew etc.
* Displayed the weather of my hometown.
